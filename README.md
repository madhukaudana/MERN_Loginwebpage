In here,
I create sign in page and login page. When you sign in to the page It automatically send email to your email address to verify your email address. After you verify your email address it automatically go to the login page. If you have already create an account you can directly go through the login page.
Also you have to add your account type (admin or student) when you firstly sign in to the page.
If you try to sign in without filling first name, last name, email, type, Tel-number, or Acc-type it will pop up an error message. And also if you enter a wrong email like without @ or anything it will show the email is not correct.
