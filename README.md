In here,
I create sign in page and login page. When you sign in to the page It automatically send email to your email address to verify your email address. After you verify your email address it automatically go to the login page. If you have already create an account you can directly go through the login page.

Also you have to add your date of birth, account type(admin or student),Tel-number,status after you varified the email address.

If you try to sign in without filling name, email or anthing it will pop up an error message. And also if you enter a wrong email like without @ or anything it will show the email is not correct.

how to Run the code- you have to fork or download the code and run the "npm i " command inside the client and sever folders. after you run the code every modules will install. after thet you have to run the sever insde the server folder using "node index.js" command. after you run the server you have to run "npm start" command on the client folder. 

I put my mongodb database connection link on the code. (if there is any problem "mongodb+srv://localhostdb:Password@crud.qpgmk31.mongodb.net/LoginUser?retryWrites=true&w=majority" this is the link for database.
